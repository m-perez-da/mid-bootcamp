# Project title: Volume study in S&P500 index.

Study about how variation in volume over a period, can give us clues about potential sector winners for the next period.

### Instructions

1. Open the `categoricals` variable we created before.

```python
categoricals = data.select_dtypes(np.object)
categoricals.head()
```

2. Plot all the categorical variables with the proper plot. What can you see?
3. There might be some columns that seem to be redundant, check their values to be sure. What should we do with them?
4. Plot time variable. Can you extract something from it?
