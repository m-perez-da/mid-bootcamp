# Project title: Volume study in S&P500 index

Study about how variation in volume over a period, can give us clues about potential sector winners for the next period.

### Motivation

There are lot of articles and methods about markets forecast (chart figures, indicators, Elliot waves,..), but no special attention to volume.

This work is about volume trends. By studying variation in volume over a period of time (quarters), I will try to detect where the biggest market players (funds and investment banks) are putting (or withdrawing) their money. 

I assume that big funds trade a big amount of volume, and it is not ease for them to hide when they are changing its portfolio (looking for sectors with better perspectives). It seems to be a good idea to invest in those sectors, and try to beat the market!   

### Development
